# FS_file_analyzer
Analyses a series of directories defined by the user and returns the potential savings by deleting files older than X years


## Overview
This tool provides a detailed analysis of disk space usage by examining file ages within specified directories. It categorizes files based on their ageâ€”determining how much space could be saved by deleting files older than 1, 3, 5, and 10 years (customizable). The analysis results are visualized in a series of bar graphs, saved as an image file, which makes it easy to interpret the potential savings across multiple directories.

## Features
Multi-Folder Analysis: Analyze multiple folders simultaneously for a comprehensive overview.
Customizable Age Thresholds: Easily adjust the age thresholds for analyzing file ages.
Graphical Output: Visualizes disk space usage in bar graphs, grouped by folder, with results saved as a PNG image.
Efficiency: Utilizes pandas for data handling and matplotlib for generating graphics, optimized for large datasets.


## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library
- Numpy library

You can install the required packages using pip:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```

## Usage
To use this tool, follow these steps:

- Edit the config.py file and setup your target directories and age thresholds you want in the final report

#### Prepare Your Data:
- Run the scan_folders.py script. Ensure the resulting .csv file is generated in the same folder as the script

#### Run the processing script:
- Run the process_data.py script which will process the resulting .csv file and generate an image file with the results

#### Visualize the results.
- Check the output PNG image space_saved_by_folder.png for the graphical results.
